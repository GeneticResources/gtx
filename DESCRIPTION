Description: Assorted tools for genetic association analyses.  The current focus is on implementing (either exactly or approximately) regression analyses using summary statistics instead of using subject-specific data.  So far, functions exist to support multi-SNP risk score analyses, multi-SNP conditional regression analyses, and multi-phenotype analyses, using summary statistics.  There are helper functions for reading and manipulating subject-specific genotype data, which provide a platform for calculating the summary statistics, or for using R to conduct other analyses not supported by specific GWAS analysis tools.
